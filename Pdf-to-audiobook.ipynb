      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are quickly becoming an\n",
      "essential tool in a wide range of machine learning applications.\n",
      "In many application scenarios, CNN models â€” both its network\n",
      "structure and learnable parameters (i.e., weights) â€” need to be\n",
      "protected as conï¿¿dential information: (1) for companies that rely\n",
      "on a CNN to provide a core or value-added service, the underlying\n",
      "neural network model represents an important piece of intellectual\n",
      "property; (2) in personalized applications such as digital assistants,\n",
      "CNN models are trained using private data, and the weights need to\n",
      "be kept conï¿¿dential for privacy []; (3) furthermore, recent studies\n",
      "on the adversarial network show that an attacker can intentionally\n",
      "aï¿¿ect the outcome of CNN-based classiï¿¿cation and object detection\n",
      "by perturbing input images when the network model is known [].\n",
      "This paper investigates reverse-engineering attacks on CNN\n",
      "models exploiting information leaks through memory and timing\n",
      "side-channels. Speciï¿¿cally, we study attacks on a hardware acceler-\n",
      "ator that is protected by secure processor techniques similar to the\n",
      "scheme used in Intel SGX []. In this setting, an adversary can feed\n",
      "inputs to a protected computation and observe oï¿¿-chip accesses,\n",
      "but cannot observe or change the computation and the internal\n",
      "state. Surprisingly, we show that an adversary can eï¿¿ectively re-\n",
      "verse engineer both the structure and the weights of an encrypted\n",
      "CNN model running on a hardware accelerator that performs the in-\n",
      "ference (i.e., forward propagation). Because the CNN states (feature\n",
      "maps) and parameters (weights) are often quite large, it is impracti-\n",

      "THREAT MODEL\n",
      "Figure 1 shows a typical CNN inference accelerator architecture\n",
      "that is used in this study. In order to ï¿¿t the input feature maps (IFMs)\n",
      "and ï¿¿lters in the on-chip buï¿¿ers, IFMs and ï¿¿lters are partitioned\n",
      "into small tiles. Then, the convolution operation is performed over\n",
      "Figure 2: Threat model.\n",
      "all the tiles sequentially. For each tile, the accelerator receives in-\n",
      "structions from the host CPU, reads an IFM tile and corresponding\n",
      "weights from an oï¿¿-chip DRAM into on-chip buï¿¿ers, performs\n",
      "matrix multiplications and accumulations in the processing ele-\n",
      "ment (PE) array, and store the intermediate results back to on-chip\n",
      "buï¿¿ers. After computing over all tiles, the accelerator combines the\n",
      "intermediate results and writes an output feature map (OFM) back\n",
      "to DRAM after activation and pooling. The shared cache between\n",
      "the accelerator and CPU is not considered as part of the architecture.\n",
      "The reasons are threefold: (1) the data locality has been exploited\n",
      "by the on-chip buï¿¿ers; (2) the shared cache is not able to hold all\n",
      "feature maps (FMAPs) and weights; (3) using shared cache to store\n",
      "FMAPs and weights can signiï¿¿cantly degrade the performance of\n",
      "other applications, which are sharing the cache. The FMAPs and\n",
      "weights are typically stored in DRAM, while the intermediate re-\n",
      "sults are kept in on-chip buï¿¿ers. After ï¿¿nishing the computation of\n",
      "all layers in a forward-propagation fashion, the accelerator returns\n",
      "the probabilities of each class as the classiï¿¿cation result.\n",
      "Figure 2 illustrates the threat model, which captures the common\n",
      "protection capabilities provided by todayâ€™s secure processor tech-\n",
      "nologies such as Intel SGX []. The internal operations and state\n",
      "of the CNN accelerator cannot be directly observed or changed\n",
      "by an adversary. The CNN accelerator encrypts feature maps (in-\n",
      "put/output of each layer) and weights in DRAM so that their values\n",
      "are protected. However, the adversary can control inputs to the\n",
      "accelerator and observe the address and the type (read or write) for\n",
      "each oï¿¿-chip memory access. The above threat model represents\n",
      "what is typically employed for todayâ€™s secure processors and the\n",
      "level of protection that can be implemented with low overhead. For\n",
      "example, Intel SGX is designed to provide an isolated and protected\n",

      "In order to construct a neural network, an adversary needs to know\n",
      "the number of layers, parameters for each layer, and connections\n",
      "among layers. A typical CNN uses a simple sequential connection\n",
      "only between consecutive layers. More recent proposal [] intro-\n",
      "duces an additional bypass connection among layers.\n",
      "We show that memory access patterns relatively easily reveal the\n",
      "overall layer structure through read-after-write (RAW) dependency.\n",
      "During the CNN inference, the RAW dependency on FMAPs must\n",
      "be preserved by the accelerator, regardless of its micro-architecture\n",
      "details and data reuse strategies. The OFMs are written by a pre-\n",
      "ceding layer and is read as the IFMs by the following layer. Since\n",
      "FMAPs are stored oï¿¿-chip, this RAW dependency is reï¿¿ected in\n",
      "the memory trace and visible to the adversary as a write followed\n",
      "by a read on the same memory address. These RAW dependencies\n",
      "can be used by the adversary to identify the boundary as well as\n",
      "the connections between layers. More concretely, the beginning of\n",
      "a new convolutional/fully connected layer is revealed by the ï¿¿rst\n",
      "read access on a memory address that was previously written.\n",
      "Once the layer boundaries are identiï¿¿ed, the adversary needs\n",
      "to further reverse engineer the key parameters of each layer. The\n",
      "ï¿¿rst step towards this goal is to distinguish memory accesses to\n",
      "ï¿¿lters, IFM, and OFM. Since the ï¿¿lters are read-only and not up-\n",
      "dated during the inference, the adversary can diï¿¿erentiate memory\n",
      "accesses to ï¿¿lters from those accessing FMAPs. The read/write\n",
      "operations on IFM and OFM can also be distinguished since they\n",
      "have diï¿¿erent access patterns. During the computation within a\n",
      "layer, memory locations holding OFM will only be written, typi-\n",
      "cally once. In contrast, if the adversary observes a read access on\n",
      "an address written in the previous layer before, this read must be\n",
      "for IFM. FMAPs and ï¿¿lters are stored as arrays in memory, which\n",
      "means that each is stored in its own contiguous memory locations.\n",
      "Therefore, an adversary can infer the sizes of IFM (SIZEI F M), OFM\n",
      "(SIZEOF M), and ï¿¿lters (SIZEF LT R) of each layer by observing the\n",
      "memory locations accessed for each data structure within a layer.\n",
      "So far, we have shown that the memory access pattern of a\n",
      "CNN accelerator reveals the number of layers, data dependencies\n",
      "(connections) among layers, the size of the IFM, OFM, and ï¿¿lters\n",
      "for each layer in the target CNN model. However, not all operations\n",
      "\n",
      "in the neural network are explicitly revealed by the memory access\n",
      "pattern. For example, a CNN performs an activation operation\n",
      "after each convolution followed by an optional pooling operation.\n",
      "These three operations are often merged and performed together\n",

      "Ppool should be smaller than Fconï¿½ and Fpool respectively because\n",
      "the convolutional/pooling ï¿¿lter operating on zero-valued pixels is\n",
      "equivalent to adding zero-padding for the next layer.\n",
      "In our threat model, the adversary also has the knowledge of\n",
      "input and output of the accelerator which reveals the WI F M and\n",
      "DI F M of the ï¿¿rst layer and the DOF M of the last layer. Although\n",
      "there is no previous write on the IFM of the ï¿¿rst layer, the SIZEI F M\n",
      "can be calculated using Equation 1 and thus distinguished from the\n",
      "weights. Moreover, the WOF M of the last layer is one since there is\n",

      "pruning, the adversary can observe the changes in the number of\n",

      "THREAT MODEL\n",
      "Figure 1 shows a typical CNN inference accelerator architecture\n",
      "that is used in this study. In order to ï¿¿t the input feature maps (IFMs)\n",
      "and ï¿¿lters in the on-chip buï¿¿ers, IFMs and ï¿¿lters are partitioned\n",
      "into small tiles. Then, the convolution operation is performed over\n",
      "Figure 2: Threat model.\n",
      "all the tiles sequentially. For each tile, the accelerator receives in-\n",
      "structions from the host CPU, reads an IFM tile and corresponding\n",
      "weights from an oï¿¿-chip DRAM into on-chip buï¿¿ers, performs\n",
      "matrix multiplications and accumulations in the processing ele-\n",
      "ment (PE) array, and store the intermediate results back to on-chip\n",
      "buï¿¿ers. After computing over all tiles, the accelerator combines the\n",
      "intermediate results and writes an output feature map (OFM) back\n",
      "to DRAM after activation and pooling. The shared cache between\n",
      "the accelerator and CPU is not considered as part of the architecture.\n",
      "The reasons are threefold: (1) the data locality has been exploited\n",
      "by the on-chip buï¿¿ers; (2) the shared cache is not able to hold all\n",
      "feature maps (FMAPs) and weights; (3) using shared cache to store\n",
      "FMAPs and weights can signiï¿¿cantly degrade the performance of\n",
      "other applications, which are sharing the cache. The FMAPs and\n",
      "weights are typically stored in DRAM, while the intermediate re-\n",
      "sults are kept in on-chip buï¿¿ers. After ï¿¿nishing the computation of\n",
      "all layers in a forward-propagation fashion, the accelerator returns\n",
      "the probabilities of each class as the classiï¿¿cation result.\n",
      "Figure 2 illustrates the threat model, which captures the common\n",
      "protection capabilities provided by todayâ€™s secure processor tech-\n",
      "nologies such as Intel SGX []. The internal operations and state\n",
      "of the CNN accelerator cannot be directly observed or changed\n",
      "by an adversary. The CNN accelerator encrypts feature maps (in-\n",
      "put/output of each layer) and weights in DRAM so that their values\n",
      "are protected. However, the adversary can control inputs to the\n",
      "accelerator and observe the address and the type (read or write) for\n",
      "each oï¿¿-chip memory access. The above threat model represents\n",
      "what is typically employed for todayâ€™s secure processors and the\n",
      "level of protection that can be implemented with low overhead. For\n",
      "example, Intel SGX is designed to provide an isolated and protected\n",
      "execution environment for a security-critical program, even when\n",
      "an operating system is untrusted or a system is physically exposed.\n",
      "In such systems, the internal operations and state of a program are\n",

      "memory to detect changes [10].\n",

      "Attack Methodology\n",
      "In order to construct a neural network, an adversary needs to know\n",
      "the number of layers, parameters for each layer, and connections\n",
      "among layers. A typical CNN uses a simple sequential connection\n",
      "only between consecutive layers. More recent proposal [] intro-\n",
      "duces an additional bypass connection among layers.\n",
      "We show that memory access patterns relatively easily reveal the\n",
      "overall layer structure through read-after-write (RAW) dependency.\n",
      "During the CNN inference, the RAW dependency on FMAPs must\n",
      "be preserved by the accelerator, regardless of its micro-architecture\n",
      "details and data reuse strategies. The OFMs are written by a pre-\n",
      "ceding layer and is read as the IFMs by the following layer. Since\n",
      "FMAPs are stored oï¿¿-chip, this RAW dependency is reï¿¿ected in\n",
      "the memory trace and visible to the adversary as a write followed\n",
      "by a read on the same memory address. These RAW dependencies\n",
      "can be used by the adversary to identify the boundary as well as\n",
      "the connections between layers. More concretely, the beginning of\n",
      "a new convolutional/fully connected layer is revealed by the ï¿¿rst\n",
      "read access on a memory address that was previously written.\n",
      "Once the layer boundaries are identiï¿¿ed, the adversary needs\n",
      "to further reverse engineer the key parameters of each layer. The\n",
      "ï¿¿rst step towards this goal is to distinguish memory accesses to\n",
      "ï¿¿lters, IFM, and OFM. Since the ï¿¿lters are read-only and not up-\n",
      "dated during the inference, the adversary can diï¿¿erentiate memory\n",
      "accesses to ï¿¿lters from those accessing FMAPs. The read/write\n",
      "operations on IFM and OFM can also be distinguished since they\n",
      "have diï¿¿erent access patterns. During the computation within a\n",
      "layer, memory locations holding OFM will only be written, typi-\n",
      "cally once. In contrast, if the adversary observes a read access on\n",
      "an address written in the previous layer before, this read must be\n",
      "for IFM. FMAPs and ï¿¿lters are stored as arrays in memory, which\n",
      "means that each is stored in its own contiguous memory locations.\n",
      "Therefore, an adversary can infer the sizes of IFM (SIZEI F M), OFM\n",
      "(SIZEOF M), and ï¿¿lters (SIZEF LT R) of each layer by observing the\n",
      "memory locations accessed for each data structure within a layer.\n",
      "So far, we have shown that the memory access pattern of a\n",
      "CNN accelerator reveals the number of layers, data dependencies\n",
      "(connections) among layers, the size of the IFM, OFM, and ï¿¿lters\n",
      "for each layer in the target CNN model. However, not all operations\n",
      "\n",
      "in the neural network are explicitly revealed by the memory access\n",
      "pattern. For example, a CNN performs an activation operation\n",
      "after each convolution followed by an optional pooling operation.\n",
      "These three operations are often merged and performed together\n",
      "as a single layer in CNN accelerator for eï¿¿ciency. As a result,\n",
      "the internal outputs of these three operations are invisible to the\n",

      "In many application scenarios, CNN models â€” both its network\n",

      "CNN models are trained using private data, and the weights need to\n",

      "typically store feature maps and weights in oï¿¿-chip memory and\n",

      "access patterns reveal which memory locations are accessed and\n",
      "whether each access is a read or a write. In this study, we show\n",
      "that the memory access patterns expose key parameters of the net-\n",
      "work structure such as the number of layers, input/output sizes\n",
      "of each layer, the size of ï¿¿lters, data dependencies among layers,\n",
      "etc. Given this information, an attacker can infer a small set of\n",
      "possible network structures by further considering the execution\n",

      "that the memory access patterns also leak information on weight\n",
      "values when dynamic zero pruning is used for oï¿¿-chip memory\n",

      "that these feature maps can be compressed in DRAM by only storing\n",
      "non-zero values and the associated indices to signiï¿¿cantly reduce\n",
      "the memory bandwidth usage. Unfortunately, this optimization\n",
      "leaks the number of zero-valued pixels pruned by the activation\n",
      "function, which can be leveraged to infer the ratio between each\n",

      "\n",
      "THREAT MODEL\n",
      "Figure 1 shows a typical CNN inference accelerator architecture\n",
      "that is used in this study. In order to ï¿¿t the input feature maps (IFMs)\n",
      "and ï¿¿lters in the on-chip buï¿¿ers, IFMs and ï¿¿lters are partitioned\n",
      "into small tiles. Then, the convolution operation is performed over\n",
      "Figure 2: Threat model.\n",
      "all the tiles sequentially. For each tile, the accelerator receives in-\n",
      "structions from the host CPU, reads an IFM tile and corresponding\n",
      "weights from an oï¿¿-chip DRAM into on-chip buï¿¿ers, performs\n",
      "matrix multiplications and accumulations in the processing ele-\n",
      "ment (PE) array, and store the intermediate results back to on-chip\n",
      "buï¿¿ers. After computing over all tiles, the accelerator combines the\n",
      "intermediate results and writes an output feature map (OFM) back\n",
      "to DRAM after activation and pooling. The shared cache between\n",
      "the accelerator and CPU is not considered as part of the architecture.\n",
      "The reasons are threefold: (1) the data locality has been exploited\n",
      "by the on-chip buï¿¿ers; (2) the shared cache is not able to hold all\n",
      "feature maps (FMAPs) and weights; (3) using shared cache to store\n",
      "FMAPs and weights can signiï¿¿cantly degrade the performance of\n",
      "other applications, which are sharing the cache. The FMAPs and\n",
      "weights are typically stored in DRAM, while the intermediate re-\n",
      "sults are kept in on-chip buï¿¿ers. After ï¿¿nishing the computation of\n",
      "all layers in a forward-propagation fashion, the accelerator returns\n",
      "the probabilities of each class as the classiï¿¿cation result.\n",
      "Figure 2 illustrates the threat model, which captures the common\n",
      "protection capabilities provided by todayâ€™s secure processor tech-\n",
      "nologies such as Intel SGX []. The internal operations and state\n",
      "of the CNN accelerator cannot be directly observed or changed\n",
      "by an adversary. The CNN accelerator encrypts feature maps (in-\n",
      "put/output of each layer) and weights in DRAM so that their values\n",
      "are protected. However, the adversary can control inputs to the\n",
      "accelerator and observe the address and the type (read or write) for\n",
      "each oï¿¿-chip memory access. The above threat model represents\n",
      "what is typically employed for todayâ€™s secure processors and the\n",
      "level of protection that can be implemented with low overhead. For\n",
      "example, Intel SGX is designed to provide an isolated and protected\n",
      "execution environment for a security-critical program, even when\n",
      "an operating system is untrusted or a system is physically exposed.\n",
      "In such systems, the internal operations and state of a program are\n",
      "protected, although inputs and outputs are still exposed to an adver-\n",
      "sary. Memory accesses can be directly observed through physical\n",
      "probing of a memory bus or inserting hardware Trojan. A compro-\n",
      "mised OS can also observe memory accesses through side channels\n",
      "such as page faults and cache conï¿¿icts [] or by repeated reading\n",
      "memory to detect changes [10].\n",
      "The objective of the reverse-engineering attacks studied in this\n",
      "paper is to construct a duplicated CNN model that has comparable\n",
      "accuracy to the target model by observing the hardware accelerator.\n",
      "This paper studies two diï¿¿erent reverse-engineering attacks on\n",
      "CNNs. The ï¿¿rst attack aims to reverse engineer a network structure\n",
      "(Section 3). The second attack aims to ï¿¿nd weight values (Section 4).\n",

      "In order to construct a neural network, an adversary needs to know\n",
      "the number of layers, parameters for each layer, and connections\n",
      "among layers. A typical CNN uses a simple sequential connection\n",
      "only between consecutive layers. More recent proposal [] intro-\n",
      "duces an additional bypass connection among layers.\n",
      "We show that memory access patterns relatively easily reveal the\n",
      "overall layer structure through read-after-write (RAW) dependency.\n",
      "During the CNN inference, the RAW dependency on FMAPs must\n",
      "be preserved by the accelerator, regardless of its micro-architecture\n",
      "details and data reuse strategies. The OFMs are written by a pre-\n",
      "ceding layer and is read as the IFMs by the following layer. Since\n",
      "FMAPs are stored oï¿¿-chip, this RAW dependency is reï¿¿ected in\n",
      "the memory trace and visible to the adversary as a write followed\n",
      "by a read on the same memory address. These RAW dependencies\n",
      "can be used by the adversary to identify the boundary as well as\n",
      "the connections between layers. More concretely, the beginning of\n",
      "a new convolutional/fully connected layer is revealed by the ï¿¿rst\n",
      "read access on a memory address that was previously written.\n",
      "Once the layer boundaries are identiï¿¿ed, the adversary needs\n",
      "to further reverse engineer the key parameters of each layer. The\n",
      "ï¿¿rst step towards this goal is to distinguish memory accesses to\n",
      "ï¿¿lters, IFM, and OFM. Since the ï¿¿lters are read-only and not up-\n",
      "dated during the inference, the adversary can diï¿¿erentiate memory\n",
      "accesses to ï¿¿lters from those accessing FMAPs. The read/write\n",
      "operations on IFM and OFM can also be distinguished since they\n",
      "have diï¿¿erent access patterns. During the computation within a\n",
      "layer, memory locations holding OFM will only be written, typi-\n",
      "cally once. In contrast, if the adversary observes a read access on\n",
      "an address written in the previous layer before, this read must be\n",
      "for IFM. FMAPs and ï¿¿lters are stored as arrays in memory, which\n",
      "means that each is stored in its own contiguous memory locations.\n",
      "Therefore, an adversary can infer the sizes of IFM (SIZEI F M), OFM\n",
      "(SIZEOF M), and ï¿¿lters (SIZEF LT R) of each layer by observing the\n",
      "memory locations accessed for each data structure within a layer.\n",
      "So far, we have shown that the memory access pattern of a\n",
      "CNN accelerator reveals the number of layers, data dependencies\n",
      "(connections) among layers, the size of the IFM, OFM, and ï¿¿lters\n",
      "for each layer in the target CNN model. However, not all operations\n",
      "\n",
      "in the neural network are explicitly revealed by the memory access\n",
      "pattern. For example, a CNN performs an activation operation\n",
      "after each convolution followed by an optional pooling operation.\n",
      "These three operations are often merged and performed together\n",

      "the convolutional/pooling ï¿¿lter operating on zero-valued pixels is\n",

      "Attack Methodology\n",
      "In a CNN accelerator, diï¿¿erent inputs lead to a diï¿¿erent number of\n",

      "pruning, the adversary can observe the changes in the number of\n",
      "non-zero pixels in OFM. If the activation function f maps negative\n",
      "values to zero as in ReLU, the change in the number of zeros in OFM\n",
      "actually reveals when a pixel crosses the zero boundary. The value\n",
      "of each pixelï¿½ in OFM can be expressed as a function of the value of\n",
      "pixels x in IFM, weights w, and a bias b, that is ï¿½ = f (Ã•\n",
      "i wi Â·xi +b).\n",
      "Therefore, if an adversary can slowly change the pixel values in\n",
      "IFM and observe the number of zeros in OFM, the adversary can\n",

      "(Ã•\n",
      "i wi Â·xi +b = 0). If the adversary can ï¿¿nd out which pixel is zero,\n",
      "then one can write a set of linear equations for wi and b given that\n",
      "the values of input xi are known.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the dynamic zero pruning only leaks the number\n",
      "of zero-valued pixels in OFM while the exact locations of those\n",
      "pixels along W , H, and D dimensions remain unknown. To solve\n",
      "the problem, an adversary can provide carefully crafted inputs to\n",
